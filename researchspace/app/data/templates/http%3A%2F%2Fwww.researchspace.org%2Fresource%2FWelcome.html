          <h3>Welcome to ResearchSpace</h3>
          <p class="style--readable" style="margin: 40px 0;" >ResearchSpace is a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/">British Museum</a> project, funded by the <a target="_blank" href="https://mellon.org/">Mellon Foundation</a>, which uses semantic web technology to support cultural heritage research. The system is founded on the principles of knowledge representation and the need to elevate the status of data by including meaning and context at the data's source, rather than relying on the interpretation of 'raw' data through programming code.</p><hr>

<h4 style="margin-top:40px">The ResearchSpace Approach</h4>
<p class="style--readable">By turning information systems on their head and giving greater attention to the data itself, the following benefits result:</p>
<ul class="style--readable">          
<li>Search systems become more relevant to research methods, because instead of relying on keywords, researchers can apply the right context to their exploration of data and understand the results that they get.</li>
<li>Data is more transparent. Knowledge can be built upon rather than fragmented because the data conforms to essential scholarly requirements. This means that better collaboration can be supported.
Humanists become an essential part of building open systems – they can directly transfer their knowledge to the Web without being programmers. A better balance of inter-disciplinary work can take place.</li>
<li>Information with meaning and context can be more reliably integrated into larger knowledge systems, supporting a fusion of qualitative and quantitative methods.</li>
<li>Because semantic data is independent of software it is inherently a preservation format.</li>
</ul>
          
<h4 style="margin-top:40px">Improving Data</h4>
<p class="style--readable">By presenting data in this way nothing is covered up. This means that both the strengths as well as the weaknesses of source data are exposed. This is a feature of ResearchSpace and different datasets will exhibit different strengths and weaknesses. Its method of representation means that it can accommodate data that may have quality or data management issues and therefore help identify potential improvements. It is hoped that by being transparent it can generate a conversation about how cultural heritage can be better curated for the open environment of the Web, and for different audiences.</p>
          
<h4 style="margin-top:40px">The Purpose of this Site</h4>
<p class="style--readable">ResearchSpace is a research system and will, on completion, be available for download. This site will be used to show working versions of ResearchSpace and showcase new functionality as it comes online. ResearchSpace is an interactive system and therefore as an anonymous user only the “read-only” elements will be available.  In the first quarter of 2017, ResearchSpace will provide user logins to those interested in using ResearchSpace for their projects, so that they may get a fuller picture of its research capabilities.</p>
