          <h3>ResearchSpace Features</h3>
          <p>ResearchSpace is a <a target="_blank" href="http://britishmuseum.org">British Museum</a> project, funded by the <a target="_blank" href="https://mellon.org">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>, that uses <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">Semantic Web</a> technology to support cultural heritage research.</p>
          <p>It provides an integrated environment for contextual data and tools designed to reflect research methods, including Semantic Search, Personal Clipboards, Argumentation, Semantic Narratives and Annotation, Image manipulation and annotation tools using IIIF, Security and Workflow, and a Semantic Web Database Builder. </p>
          <p>The system is founded on the principles of knowledge representation and the need to elevate the status of data by including meaning and context at source, rather than relying on the interpretation of "raw" data through programming code. It exposes data "as is", identifying strengths and weaknesses and key areas of enrichment and extension, providing transparency for scholarly activity.</p>

These features will be progressively added to the public ResearchSpace site between now and July 2017.\")
              (\"Semantic Search\" \"/images/features/feature_02.png\" \"Search different types of information using contextual relationships and in hierarchical structures that reflect real world concepts.  Use the power of the CIDOC CRM ontology in an accessible interface that can be configured for different users and purposes. Use a universal language to explore across different heterogeneous datasets, whether tangible or intangible. Export and share information.\")
              (\"Geo Search\" \"/images/features/feature_03.png\" \"Use a map to search resources with digital coordinates. By selecting an area on the map all places within the boundaries of the area selected will be included in the search. \")
              (\"Semantic Clipboard\" \"/images/features/feature_04.png\" \"Save items to your own research space and create your own datasets. The clipboard saves different resources (things, people, places, images, etc. and organises data into sets. Use clipboard items to manipulate searches, inform arguments and underpin narratives. The clipboard allows your activity to be managed and organised privately and collaboratively.\")
              (\"Semantic Annotation & Semantic Narratives\" \"/images/features/feature_05.png\" \"ResearchSpace provides an intersection between meaningful structured data and analytical narratives. It allows you to write about individual resources (annotations) or general articles (general narratives). These narratives can be underpinned by the data saved in the clipboard and visualised in the narratives themselves to create digital essays backed up with more than just bibliographic citations. These essays are related to the resources that they reference.\")
              (\"Assertions and Arguments\" \"/images/features/feature_06.png\" \"ResearchSpace employs a structured way to assert new data against existing information. Disagree with third party data and add your own beliefs recorded with full provenance. Extend your assertions to new fields or &apos;patterns&apos; of information to enrich source data with new and engaging research information. Arguments are based on observation, belief adoption and inference â€“ the use of premises to support a conclusion.\")
              (\"Image Annotation with IIIF\" \"/images/features/feature_07.png\" \"ResearchSpace uses the IIIF standard for streaming high resolution images and has incorporated an annotation system that works with the CIDOC CRM standard. Image regions can be defined and become a related resource which can be annotated with semantic annotations and used in arguments.\")
              (\"Lightbox\" \"/images/features/feature_08.png\" \"View and manipulate images and images regions in specially organised sets. The lightbox uses the IIIF streaming image standard.  Compare, overlay and link images.\")
              (\"Semantic Web Database\" \"/images/features/feature_09.png\" \"Research questions require flexible and dynamic database systems. Use the associated ResearchSpace Semantic Database system to define new patterns of knowledge and create custom input screens for project members. Choose from an increasing database of knowledge patterns and share these with the community.\")
