<div style="text-align:center;width:500px;margin:50px">This class comprises works whose essence is the selection and/or arrangement of expressions of one or more other works. This does not make the contents of the aggregated expressions part of this work, but only part of the resulting expression. F17 Aggregation Work may include additional original parts.
An expression of a work may include expressions of other works within it. For instance, an anthology of poems is regarded as a work in its own right that makes use of expressions of the individual poems that have been selected and ordered as part of an intellectual process.
A new version of an aggregate work does not make the resulting complex work an aggregate work as well. The inclusion of expressions from a complex work in an aggregation work does not make the aggregation work itself complex.</div>
