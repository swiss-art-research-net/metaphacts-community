      <h3>About ResearchSpace</h3>
      <p class="style--readable"><strong>ResearchSpace</strong> started life looking into the problem of integrating the activity and results of cultural heritage research projects. As different projects went about the task of answering various research questions or producing educational systems using digital platforms, the question of how the accumulated knowledge and information could be shared and built upon by others became a fundamental research question in its own right. How could we ensure that digital projects contributed collaboratively and incrementally to long term scholarship and education and make the investment in digital justifiable?</p>
      <p class="style--readable"><strong>ResearchSpace identified a significant problem</strong>. While software has become more sophisticated and flexible, ways of representing data have remained fairly static. The project realised that more effort was needed to elevate data as the fundmental constituent of open world systems. By embedding the semantics and meaning that is traditionally generated in software code by developers into the data itself by subject experts a number of things became possible:</p>
      <ul class="style--readable">
        <li>The data became ‘independent’ of the software and while it could be used in digital systems it no longer became dependent on any particular system. Its meaning could be preserved in simple text files for the next project and potentially institutionalised for the next generation. The data lived on regardless of the software platform.</li>
        <li>The data became naturally more open to integration. Instead of using complex coding and matching algorithms, the data itself provided the necessary information for harmonising heterogeneous knowledge.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="style--readable">However, how to use this different type of ‘living’ data was still a problem. This view of of data as a first class independent citizen was one that traditional database systems and processes did not lend themselves to well.</p>
      <p class="style--readable"><strong>The development of database systems</strong> employing graph-like structures potentially provided better frameworks for a new type of Semantic data, but these new databases had much less history and development behind them compared to traditional systems (e.g. relational), and presented a whole new set of problems for accessible user oriented applications. The format called ‘Linked Data’ provided a technical base but by itself only resolved some problems, and created others. The ResearchSpace project looked into these problems and tried to come up with a solution using a prototyping project. A completed working prototype pushed boundaries and provided insight into what was required to support a fully working production cultural heritage application, capable of supporting many different types of dataset. This phase of analysis exploration was essential to properly consider these isues and ultimately address the complex humanities brief, something that could support cultural heritage institutions, provide high academic standards, and which could work in parallel with traditional scholarship methods.</p>
      <p class="style--readable"><strong>This phase of the ResearchSpace</strong> delivers the fruits of that work. This release is staggered and during the next 6 months will implement all the components highlighted on this site. It is the culmination of a large effort involving a community of people interested in bringing, not just data together, but people and knowledge. The core of ResearchSpace is ultimately its adherence to principles of knowledge representation and the ability to capture data with the meaning that its creators originally attributed to it, whether they be curators, librarians, archivists or humanist researchers generally. The software used in ResearchSpace is sophisticated and the platform used is an essential part of the current ResearchSpace system, but its real engine is the use of knowledge representation in the form of CIDOC CRM. Without the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model, and the 25 years of its development by highly motivated and dedicated scholars and cultural heritage experts, this application would not have been possible.</p>
