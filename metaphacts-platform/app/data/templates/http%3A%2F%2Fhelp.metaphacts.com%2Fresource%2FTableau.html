    <h1>Tableau</h1>
    <p>
      The tableau endpoint is by default enabled and can be accessed by entering the endpoint URL 
        <span><mp-platform-url class="bg-info" path="/tableau"></mp-platform-url></span> 
      when creating a new Web Data Connector in Tableau Desktop.
    </p>
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    Depending on the use-case different prerequisites must be fullfilled:
    <ul>
      <li><code>allowedCrossOrigin</code> must in be set in environment configuration properties (c.f. <semantic-link uri='[[resolvePrefix "Help:BasicSystemConfiguration"]]'>System Configuration</semantic-link>) to enable cross origin access from whatever host system the endpoint should be accessible.
      </li>      
      <li>In order to create a data source based on a SPARQL Select query, the user must have at least <code>sparql:query:select</code> permissions.
      </li>
      <li>In order to access the REST services which are exposed through the QAAS (Query as a Service) interface, the user must at least have the <code>qaas:info</code> permissions as well as the permissions which are directly assigned to the individual services (<code>qaas:execute:...</code>) and are required to execute them.
      </li>
      <li>If anonymous user access is enabled for the platform, the tableau endpoint is only  accessible by the <code>anonymous</code> user, which needs to have at least one of the above listed permissions.
      </li>
    </ul>
