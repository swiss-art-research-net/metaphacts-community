    <div class="documentation__intro__description">
      The full-text search supports a special query syntax to express complex queries.<br/>

  <br/>
  <h4>Searching for a single keyword</h4>
  <p>By default, the system looks for exact matches of provided keywords. For example, searching for an Actor by the keyword <code>michel</code> will return e.g., "Michel Molart" and "Michel Cazin", but not "Michelangelo".</p>
  
  <h4>Keywords with wildcards</h4>
  <p>The system supports single and supports multiple character wildcard searches within single terms.</p>
  <p>For example, searching for <code>mar?</code> will return actors with names spelled as "Mark" and "Marc"</p>
  <p>To perform a multiple character wildcard search use the "*" symbol. Multiple character wildcard searches looks for 0 or more characters.</p>
  <p>For example, searching for <code>michel*</code> will return both "Michel Molart" and "Michelangelo".</p>
  
  <h4>Combining multiple keywords</h4>
  <p>For a query containing two keywords, the system will return results matching both the first AND the second one.</p>
  <p>For example, searching for <code>captain cook</code> will include "Captain James Cook", but not "Elizabeth Cook" or "Captain John van Gelder".</p>
  <p>In order to get the results matching either of the two keywords, one has to use the conjunction <code>OR</code>. Search for <code>captain or cook</code> returns multiple results including either "Captain" or "Cook"</p>
  
  <h4>Exact phrase match</h4>
  <p>Using quotes <code>""</code> enclosing several keywords tells the system to search for an exact match of the whole phrase.</p>
  <p>For example, searching for <code>british museum</code> will return both "The British Museum" and "British Salonika Force Museum". But searching for <code>"british museum"</code> will only retrieve the first of the two.</p>
  
  <h4>Excluding keywords</h4>
  <p>You can use the modifier <code>NOT</code> or the minus sign <code>-</code> to specify the keywords which should be excluded from the results.</p>
  <p>For instance, a query <code>cook</code> will return "Elizabeth Cook" in the results, but <code>cook -elizabeth</code> will exclude it from the result set.</p>
  
  <h4>Grouping</h4>
  <p>You can use parentheses <code>()</code> to group clauses to form sub queries. This can be very useful if you want to control the boolean logic for a query.</p>
  <p>For example, a query for things <code>(xiv or xv) and louis</code> will return results mentioning both Louis XIV and Louis XV.</p>
