[[!--
Empty, as the page header for resources now lives outside the page itself.
Having the header as part of the page is deprected. Instead, the header can
be set in a separate template. Examples:
* To set a header for the type foaf:Person --> Header in Header:foaf:Person
* To set a header for the resource http://www.example.com/test --> Header in Header:http://www.example.com/test
