This README contains the setup instructions for the metaphacts platform +
Blazegraph war bundle. Installation has been tested with the latest Jetty
and Tomcat releases. To install the bundle, proceed as follows.

### 1. UNZIP THE ARCHIVE
Unzip the zip archive. It contains one file, "blazegraph.war",
and one folder, "ROOT", containing the (unzipped) metaphacts-platform webapp.
For installation of the Blazegraph war, see Section 2, for installation of
the metaphacts-platform see Section 3 of this README.

### 2. INSTALLING BLAZEGRAPH
First, you need to deploy Blazegraph at the following server URL and context path:

> http://localhost:8080/bigdata.

For Tomcat, you may proceed as follows:

1. Unpack the war archive using an unarchiver
2. Copy the unpacked folder into the webapps directory of your Tomcat server,
   while renaming the folder name from "blazegraph" into "bigdata"
3. Start your tomcat server using the ./startup.sh (or ./startup.bat) script
   from within tomcat’s bin folder
4. Verify that that Blazegraph is running at http://localhost:8080/bigdata

Please consult the Blazegraph documentation in case of problems (or to obtain
guidelines for Jetty installation):

> https://wiki.blazegraph.com/wiki/index.php/NanoSparqlServer#Servlet_Container_.28Tomcat.2C_Jetty.2C_etc.29

You may want to take a look at  the “Common Startup Problems” section to avoid pitfalls.


### 3. INSTALLING THE METAPHACTS PLATFORM
Having deployed Blazegraph, we're ready to deploy the metaphacts-platform webapp.
To do so, just move the "ROOT" folder to the webapps directory of your
web server. If you deployed Blazegraph at the standard context path
"http://localhost:8080/bigdata/“, all you need to do is to restart your web
server. This will deploy the metaphacts platform at

> http://localhost:8080

Login with admin:admin (please refer to /resource/Help:BasicSystemConfiguration
in order to change the standard login).

In case Blazegraph is running on a port and/or context path, you need
to adjust the "endpoint" property in ROOT/config/config.prop accordingly.
