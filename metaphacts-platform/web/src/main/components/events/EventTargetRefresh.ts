 *
 *   <mp-event-target-refresh id='some-element'><div></div></mp-event-target-refresh>
 *
 *   <mp-event-trigger id='dom-refresh' type='Component.Refresh' targets='["some-element"]'>

 * <mp-event-target-refresh> component will be re-mounted.

 *
 *   <mp-event-target-refresh id='some-element' refresh-interval=5>
 *    <div></div>
 *   </mp-event-target-refresh>
