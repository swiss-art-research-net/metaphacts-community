## [Latest]

## [1.0.0] - 2020-03-25

    organize components into resizable panels;
  - `Canvas` to view and manipulate diagram elements and links;
  - `ClassTree` to view element type (class) hierarchy and create new element
    instances in authoring mode;

  - `ElementSearch` to view, navigate and filter currently displayed elements;
  - `LinkTypesToolbox` to display links connected to the selected element and
    manage link type visibility;
- Ability to customize canvas area by providing widgets to `Canvas`, including
  the following components:
  - `DefaultToolbar` to display default toolbar with diagram controls;
  - `Halo` and `HaloLink` to display halo on a selected element or link;
  - `Navigator` to display diagram mimi-map to quickly navigate around the diagram;
  - `CanvasWidget` to put any React components onto canvas as a widget;
- Options to `RdfDataProvider` to change class, label and property mappings.
